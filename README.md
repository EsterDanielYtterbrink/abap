# The eleventh language â€” on learning ABAP as a senior developer

Contains katas and other information on ABAP that I use

> As a senior developer I want to be able to help ABAP developers write better code,
> using the Samman method. 

## Things I need to learn
- How to lock and unlock files in Eclipse
- All the navigational shortcuts in Eclipse

## how to install it
Runs in a database, so you need the full system.
There is a Docker image that requires massive amounts of memory, 
and might still not run.
There is a cloud trial for 90 days for free, in the SAP BTB cloud.

Eclipse has editor support in extentions. 



## language
Packages, namespaces, prefixes.

The class definition is like a .h file
A method is declared with named and typed input and output.
The output variable is implicitly returned.

To run a file it first has to be activated, a bit like compiled(?)

### Naming conventions
To learn. 


### operators


### relationships to other languages
Related to Java, ObjC, SQL and Cobol. 

## Testing
Eclipse creates a testfile for each class.
There is a template (that can be improved to your liking) for creating a test class.
