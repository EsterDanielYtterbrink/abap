# Book inventory

The book object is used to represent books at a library. 

Now you have two more features to implement. 

## Audio books
The library has started to lend out audio books. 
Some books are only available in audio and some are available in print, 
other in both formats. 

## Translations
The library now wants to highlight the translators, 
and also enable finding books by original language.
