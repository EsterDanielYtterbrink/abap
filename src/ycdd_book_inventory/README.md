# Book inventory

The book object is used to represent books at a library. 

## People working at the library
- Dave working at the desk.
- Lilly managing the website.
- Susan who buys new shelves and puts books back.
- Bob who buys new books.
- Allan responisble for audibooks.
- Fran who runs a project promoting different languages.


## New assignment
Now you have two more features to implement. 

### Audio books
The library has started to lend out audio books. 
Some books are only available in audio and some are available in print, 
other in both formats. 
Allan needs the system to support this.

### Translations
Fran wants to highlight the translators, 
and also enable finding books by original language.
